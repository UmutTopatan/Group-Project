# Contributing to Student Information System

Hello Team! To maintain high code quality and satisfy our project requirements, please follow these guidelines:

## Branching Strategy
* All development should be done in `develop` or feature branches (e.g., `feature/database-setup`).
* **Direct pushes to `main` are strictly prohibited.**

## Commit Messages
We follow the semantic commit format to keep our history clean:
* `feat:` for new features (e.g., `feat: add student search`)
* `fix:` for bug fixes
* `docs:` for documentation changes
* `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature

## Pull Request (PR) Process
1. Push your changes to your feature branch.
2. Open a PR against the `develop` branch.
3. Assign at least one teammate for **Peer Review**.
4. Once approved, the PR can be merged.

## Task Management
* Ensure your task is moved to "In Progress" on the GitHub Project Board before starting.
* Link your PR to the relevant Issue (e.g., "Closes #1").
